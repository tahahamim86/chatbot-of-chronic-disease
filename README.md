# Chronic Disease Management Chatbot

## Overview

The Chronic Disease Management Chatbot is an intelligent conversational agent designed to assist patients in managing chronic diseases.
The chatbot can engage in conversations with patients, assess their symptoms, and determine their risk levels. It supports both text and voice recognition to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Allows patients to have natural conversations with the chatbot about their health.
- **Symptom Assessment**: The chatbot asks patients a series of questions to evaluate their symptoms and classify their risk levels.
- **Voice Recognition**: Supports voice input to enhance accessibility and convenience.
- **CRISP-DM Methodology**: Developed following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to ensure a structured and systematic approach.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Conversation**: Patients can start a conversation with the chatbot using text or voice input.
2. **Symptom Check**: If a patient reports feeling unwell or exhibits symptoms, the chatbot will begin a symptom assessment.
3. **Questionnaire**: The chatbot will ask a series of questions to gather information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle.
4. **Risk Classification**: Based on the patient's responses, the chatbot will classify the patient as low, medium, or high risk.
5. **Recommendations**: The chatbot provides personalized recommendations based on the risk classification, including advice on when to seek medical attention.

## Development Process

The chatbot was developed using the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Defined the objectives and scope of the chatbot to address the needs of patients with chronic diseases.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collected and analyzed data related to chronic diseases, symptoms, and patient interactions to inform the chatbot's design.
3. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessed and cleaned the data to ensure it was suitable for training the chatbot's machine learning models.
4. **Modeling**: Developed and trained the chatbot's natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to accurately understand and classify patient responses.
5. **Evaluation**: Tested the chatbot to ensure it meets performance and accuracy standards.
6. **Deployment**: Deployed the chatbot to production environments, making it available for patient use.
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the chatbot's performance and update it as needed to improve accuracy and user experience.
